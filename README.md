# Uber-Trips-Project
The aim of this project is to carryout an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Uber trips dataset from New York to derive insights
and patterns on which location and day(s) have the highest and the lowest trips or the busiest hour.  New York has a highly complex 
transportation system coupled with a large residential populace.
